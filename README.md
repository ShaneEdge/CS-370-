Pirate Intelligent Agent – Reinforcement Learning Project
Project Overview

In this project, I developed an intelligent pirate agent capable of navigating a maze environment to locate a hidden treasure using deep Q-learning. I was provided with starter code that defined the game environment, maze structure, reward system, and supporting utilities. My primary responsibility was to complete the Q-training algorithm within the Jupyter Notebook, including implementing experience replay, training a neural network to approximate Q-values, and tuning parameters such as learning rate, exploration rate, memory size, and target network updates. The final result was a trained agent that successfully learned an optimal pathfinding strategy through reinforcement learning.

Connection to Computer Science

Computer scientists design, analyze, and implement algorithms that solve complex problems efficiently and reliably. This project reflects that role by demonstrating how abstract concepts—such as reinforcement learning, neural networks, and optimization—can be applied to real-world decision-making problems like navigation and pathfinding. The work matters because intelligent systems are increasingly used in areas such as robotics, gaming, automation, and artificial intelligence, where adaptive behavior and learning from experience are critical.

Problem-Solving Approach

I approached this project by breaking the problem down into smaller, manageable components: understanding the environment, defining the agent’s goal, analyzing the reward structure, and iteratively refining the learning algorithm. Rather than hard-coding behavior, I relied on data-driven learning through exploration and exploitation. Iterative testing and evaluation were essential to ensure the agent learned efficiently and avoided suboptimal behavior, reinforcing the importance of experimentation and refinement in software development.

Ethical Responsibilities

As a computer scientist, I have an ethical responsibility to ensure that intelligent systems are designed responsibly and transparently. This includes minimizing unintended bias, ensuring systems behave as intended, and avoiding misuse of data or algorithms. In professional settings, developers must balance organizational goals with user trust, system safety, and fairness. This project reinforced the importance of designing AI systems that are explainable, tested, and aligned with ethical standards.
